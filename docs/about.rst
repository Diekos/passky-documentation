What is Passky
--------------

Passky is simple, modern, lightweight, open source and secure password manager.


How much does Passky cost?
--------------------------

Passky is open-source. This means that anyone can download it, dig into its code, and customize it to their liking. Using Passky doesn’t require an upfront cost or monthly subscription. It’s completely free to download and can be hosted by anyone who has the space to do so.
When we launched Passky, we setup two servers, each holding up to 1,000 passwords for 100 users apiece. These servers are currently open for new users. But only the first two-hundred people to sign up will get access. Possible future servers are contingent upon a number of factors. So, if you want access to the best, open-source password manager on the market, now is the time to join.


How does Passky work?
---------------------

Passky works with a MySQL database and an API which can be accessed by the Passky Website (Webclient), Desktop app or browser extension.
